LEDSprites library for Particle Photon

Refactored from original codebase to use constructor for runtime initialization, instead of initialization in C++ template.
Built to work with github.com/tenaciousRas/LEDMatrix that uses constructor instead of C++ template init.

Once you have downloaded the Zip file, it should be extracted into your Arduino Libraries folder and the folder renamed to "LEDSprites".
